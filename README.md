# DigitalDesign-ENGR85A
Codes for Course Project ENGR85A - Digital Design

(1) ALUdecoder
<br>
    This contains a basic implementation of ALUdecoder inside a microprocessor controller with few instructions and two-bit OpCode 
<br>
(2) Priority Encoder
<br>
    This is an implementation of a sequential logic block that does operation based on the priority of bits - MSB is given most importance if its 1, then the next if MSB is 0, and so on...
<br>
(3) Twos Complement
<br>
    This Mealy FSM implementation takes a binary number one bit at a time, starting with the least significant bit, and puts out its negative (two's complement), one bit at a time.
<br>
(4) Tail Light FSM
<br>
    An application of Moore's FSM on the functioning of spiffy tail light turn signal sequence of the 1965 Ford Thunderbird
<br>
(5) Adventure Game FSM
<br>
    Creating a top-level module working in tandem with one Mealy FSM which in turn communicates with another Mealy FSM
<br>
(6) Signed Adder
<br>
    Writing Behavioral SystemVerilog from a given algorithm showing Addition of Signed Numbers
<br>
(7) Capstone: Multicycle Controller
<br>
    Implementating a Moore machine which is a precursor to ALU and decodes signal to perform required tasks
<br>
