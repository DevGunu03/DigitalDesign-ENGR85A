Codes for Course Project ENGR85A - Digital Design

(1) ALUdecoder
<br>
    This contains a basic implementation of ALUdecoder inside a microprocessor controller with few instructions and two-bit OpCode 
<br>
(2) Priority Encoder
<br>
    This is an implementation of a sequential logic block that does operation based on the priority of bits - MSB is given most importance if its 1, then the next if MSB is 0, and so on...
<br>
(3) Twos Complement
<br>
    This Mealy FSM implementation takes a binary number one bit at a time, starting with the least significant bit, and puts out its negative (two's complement), one bit at a time.
<br>
(4) Tail Light FSM
<br>
    An application of Moore's FSM on the functioning of spiffy tail light turn signal sequence of the 1965 Ford Thunderbird
