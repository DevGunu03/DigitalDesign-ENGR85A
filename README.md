<br>
(2) Priority Encoder
<br>
    This is an implementation of a sequential logic block that does operation based on the priority of bits - MSB is given most importance if its 1, then the next if MSB is 0, and so on...

<br>    
(3) Twos Complement
<br>
    This Mealy FSM implementation takes a binary number one bit at a time, starting with the least significant bit, and puts out its negative (two's complement), one bit at a time.
