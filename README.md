(1) ALUdecoder
<br>
    This contains a basic implementation of ALUdecoder inside a microprocessor controller with few instructions and two-bit OpCode 
<br>
(2) Priority Encoder
<br>
    This is an implementation of a sequential logic block that does operation based on the priority of bits - MSB is given most importance, then the next if MSB is off, and so on...
